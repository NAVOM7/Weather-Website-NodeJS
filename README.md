# Weather-Application-NodeJS
This is a website which can be used to find out the details about the weather of a given location address.
* It uses mapbox.com to convert a given address to its location in Latitude and Longitude.
* Using that location, I send a http request to darksky.net server to find out the weather details.
* I used git version control and heroku server to deploy that application on to the Heroku Server.
